============

Workspace and iteration space for the AKPsi website ahead of final push for the 2014-2015 school year


Most of the code that has been written here is self-explanatory. Work still needs to be done to have the most efficient CSS styling across all pages, but all of the local files used for HTML, CSS, and Javascript are posted here. Feel free to follow the progress as I go along at www.stanford.edu/~ropeke/ or at this repository :)
